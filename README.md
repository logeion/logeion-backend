===============

Backend scripts, files, etc. for parsing/updating dictionaries.

Process for updating Logeion
----------------------------

NB: If you're running any of the Logeion generating scripts, run them in the top-level
    Logeion dir (i.e. /Users/Shared/Logeion_parsers on grade)

*   To grab Latin and Greek shortdefs, first run:
        $ scripts/update_shortdefs.py <lemmastoknow> <lexicon>
    This will update the lemmastoknow file with modified entries from the lexicon. Then,
        $ scripts/grab_lemmastoknow.py <dico> ...
          dico: [HQ | JACT | LTRG | Mastro | shortdefs | all]
    The appropriately-named files should be in the current directory; put them in the right
    spots in the dictionaries directory. Make sure that lemmastoknow.sqlite is in your
    current directory.
*   Finally, run:
        $ ./logeion_parse.py --all
    To totally regenerate the database; when it's finished, it will be in the current
    directory as new_dvlg-wheel.sqlite. parser.log will detail any errors that the
    parsers reported. (They should also be visible on STDOUT.)

    If you're only generating data for one dictionary, then run:
        $ ./logeion_parse.py <dico> --db path/to/database.db

Adding a new dictionary
-----------------------
*   A parser script must have: 
    a) a method called "parse" which returns a dict of values, formatted 
       {'head': lemma, 'content': entry} if the dico is not a textbook/not going into 
       the sidebar, and {'head': lemma, 'content': entry, 'chapter': chapter num} 
       otherwise;
    b) three global variables called "name", "type", and "caps":
        -   "name": name of the dictionary (same as dictionary folder)
        -   "type": (latin|greek|sidebar)
        -   "caps": (uncapped|source|precapped); 'uncapped' means that capitalization needs to 
            be performed on it, 'source' means that other uncapped dicos should
            be compared to it, and 'precapped' means that it shouldn't be touched during
            capitalization.
*   Regarding clean-up: the standard is to not have diacritics at all in the Latin 
    lemmas (e.g. macrons, breves, circumflexes, etc.).  For Greek lemmas, get rid of 
    anything that isn't an accent, and consult Helma if entries have multiple accents 
    (e.g. they use a circumflex for a macron).
*   Put the new parser in Logeion_parsers/parsers. It will be imported automatically.
*   Put all the dico files to be parsed in Logeion_parsers/dictionaries, in a folder 
    named the same as the dictionary. (So, NewDico should be in Logeion_parsers/NewDico.)
*   The logeion_parse.py script uses the parsers/ directory as a plugins directory, i.e.
    it will automatically load all files in that directory and call them appropriately,
    given that they have the appropriate types. It finds the xml files based on the
    "name" property in the parser file.

More on cleaning up dicos
-------------------------
*   It's been the practice to modify textbook entries by adding the unmodified lemma to the
    beginning of the entry content.  For example, {'amatus, -a, -um': 'beloved'} would be 
    added to Logeion as {'amatus': 'amatus, -a, -um, beloved'}, etc.
*   If the lemma contains diacritics that you're getting rid of, add them to the content
    first.  So, {'amātus, -a, -um': 'beloved'} => {'amatus': 'amātus, -a, -um, beloved}'.
*   XML entities are evil; excepting the core HTML entities (&(gt|lt|amp|apos|quot);), they should
    all be gone.
